# README

This project is a Ruby on Rails Interplanetary space transportation organization. The concept of the site is to be a government run transit agency. The vehicles are spaceships and the planets are realistic worlds that humans can as of today, atually colonize. The planets are Venus > Earth > Moon > Mars > Ceres > Europa. Currently, the directionality is set up to take a user in one direction and sort of functions like rail (in that it goes in one direction and you must land on each planet in order to get to another. THere are no express trips.)  

You can sign up as a user, log in, and book a trip from one planet to another, see the calculated cost which is based on authentic distance numbers. Elon Musk, of SpaceEx, postulates that by 2030 Spacex can transport humans from $100k - $200k.  Assuming that we will be able to colonize multiple planets other than Mars, our organization is set  to exist post this accomplishment. Therefore we set our Mars trip price to $50k and set all other costs per trip distance based on the $50k cost. 
 
Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version - 2.4.1 (windows users may need Ruby Version 2.4.4)

* System dependencies (none for mac, but Windows users may need a WDM gem. [needs to be removed if on mac hence why we did not include a Gemfile with this project. Feel free to contact us we can give you a gemfile and you'll need to run bundle install to generate the necessary Gemlock file.])

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* In order to run any Rails app locally, install Rails, go to the terminal and go into the project folder where you've downloaded the project. Then type "rails s". In your browser go to the page localhost:3000. With this project you'll need some Gem dependencies since there's no GEMFILE. Have fun.

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...
